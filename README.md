### Dependencies
For this code to work you need to install the discord python dependency. This can be done in your MacOS terminal:
```bash
    $ pip3 install discord.py
```
For Windows OS:
```
    $ py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

#### Notes
The only reason I made a GitHub repo is so that I don't lose this code as this bot took hours of programming. A lot of this code was inspired by code from other repositories for python projects which I converted to work with Discord too.
